# Introduction

I created this repo to easily translate English and Turkish words by using very good project, [Tureng](https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english).

This CLI basically scrapes [https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english](https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english) link to parse translation results. You can just pass the word as a parameter to translate.

You can access the package on PyPi, [bs-tureng-cli](https://pypi.org/project/bs-tureng-cli/).

# Installation

You can easily start using the CLI by installing it as a package on your Python environment.

```bash
pip install .
```

Or you can install it by using the command below

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BaysanSoft/Tureng-Translation-CLI.git
```

Or you can install by using `pip`

```bash
pip install bs-tureng-cli
```

Or you can just use `sudo make install`.

## Install As a Bash Script

If you want to use it from bash, you can just move [tureng-cli.sh](tureng-cli.sh) to `/usr/sbin/`.

**!With this kind of installation, you can use `translate` command for default.**

```bash
>>> sudo mv tureng-cli.sh /usr/sbin/
>>> turenh-cli.sh "hurricane"

### Commands as Bash script

[tureng.sh](tureng.sh) file helps us to execute commands from Bash.

Syntax:

`tureng.sh {command} "{word}" {n_result: default 15}`

Example of usage:

`tureng.sh synonym "hurricane" 15`

```bash
>>> sudo mv tureng.sh /usr/sbin/
>>> tureng.sh synonym "hurricane" 2

Hurricane synonyms
#       Synonym         Defination
1       + cyclone       +  (Meteorol.) A system of rotating winds over a vast area, spinning inward to a low pressure center (counterclockwise in the N Hemisphere) and generally causing stormy weather: commonly called a low, since it coexists with low barometric pressure
2       + typhoon       +  A violent cyclonic storm occurring in the western Pacific Ocean.
